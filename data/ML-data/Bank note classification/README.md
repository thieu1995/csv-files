* Loaded the dataset from csv file using pandas
* Observed the histogram and nature of the dataset
* Loaded the dataset
* Splitted the dataset in the ratio 0.2 for test and train
* Defined a simple nerual net as
     - **8->2**
* Final layer with softmax activation
* Compiled the model with adam optimizer
* fit the model
* Evaluated the model ( got 100% accuracy)
* Displayed the training plot (epochs v/s accuracy)
* Made predictions on the testData chosen from the dataset

**|| Split ratio was increased to .30 and accuracy changed to 99.2%**

**|| Split ratio was further increasd to .50 and accuracy changed to 96.8%**
