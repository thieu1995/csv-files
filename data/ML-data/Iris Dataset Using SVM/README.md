# IRIS DATASET

**PROBLEM : MULTI CLASS CLASSIFICATION**

**SOURCE** : UCI

**DATA ITEMS** : 150

**CLASSES** : 3


**Coded using Keras with Tensorflow backend**


 * Different classifier models like **SVM, NB, KNN** etc. are trained on the X_train set and best model was selected. - got best results with SVM ( **96.67% **)
 * **SVM** was fitted on the full dataset X
 * A testData from outside the training data was provided and made prediction
 * Prediction was printed out

Comparing the model to Finding the accuracy

 * Prediction was done on the validation set - X_validation
 * Compared with the Y_validation set using accuracy_score() function
 * Result was displayed
